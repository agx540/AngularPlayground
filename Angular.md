## 1 Getting started

### Setup Development Environment
    1. Get newest NodeJs from nodejs.org 
    2. run _npm install -g npm_
    3. run _npm uninstall -g angular/cli_
    4. run _npm cache clean_
    5. run _npm install -g @angular/cli_

## 2 Basics

### Component

### Databinding: ngModel

>_\<input type="text" [(ngModel)]="name">_

It accepts a domain model as an optional Input. If you have a one-way binding to ngModel with [] syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component class sets the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with [()] syntax (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI always syncs back to the domain model in your class.

### Databinding: string interpolation

One way databinding from model to view

>_{{propertyName}}_

### Directive: ngIf
> _<div *ngIf="condition">Content to render when condition is true.</div>_

### Directive: ngFor
Example 1

>_<app-server *ngFor="let server of servers"></app-server>_

Example 2
>\<div
>>*ngFor="let logItem of log; let i = index"

>>[ngStyle]="{backgroundColor: i >= 4 ? 'blue' : 'transparent'}"

>>[ngClass]="{'white-text': i >= 4}"

>>\>{{ logItem }}

>\</div>

### Directive: ngClass
>\<p
>> [ngClass]="{online: serverStatus === 'online'}">

>>  {{ 'Server' }} with ID {{ serverId }} is {{ getServerStatus() }}

>\</p>


### Directive: ngStyle
>\<p
>>  [ngStyle]="{backgroundColor: getColor()}"

>>  {{ 'Server' }} with ID {{ serverId }} is {{ getServerStatus() }}

>\</p>

## 4 Debugging

### Use Chrome Debugging Tools
Open Chrome debugging tools after by pressing F12.

### Use SourceMaps
Angular CLI adds SourceMaps to Javascript files when it sets up bundles for the browser to get an reference between JavaScript files and TypeScript files. Only available in development mode. They are not provided in production
mode.

Access TypeScript files:
Chrome-> F12 -> Sources -> top -> webpack -> . -> src -> app
Here you find your TypeScript file like in your dev environment.

### Use Augury
Augury is a chrome extension to debbug your Angular app. 
You can see your Router, Components and Models. Helps you 
understand and analyse your Angular app at runtime.

### Component Lifecycle
| Event                   | Description
| ------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| ngOnChanges             | Called after a bound input property changes
| ngOnInit                | Called once the component is initialized
| ngDoCheck               | Called during every change detection run
| ngAfterContentInit      | Called after content (ng-content) has been projected into view
| ngAfterContentChecked   | Called every time the projected content has been checked
| ngAfterViewInit         | Called after the componentâ€™s view (and child views) has been initialized
| ngAfterViewChecked      | Called every time the view (and child views) have been checked
| ngOnDestroy             | Called once the component is about to be destroyed
